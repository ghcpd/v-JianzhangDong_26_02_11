Hey, I've got a Python project that's failing its tests and need some help fixing it.

**The Problem:**
The app has a few issues causing test failures:
- The `build_path` function in app/utils.py is using hardcoded forward slashes instead of OS-appropriate path separators, so it's breaking on Windows
- Environment variables from .env file aren't being loaded properly - missing python-dotenv integration
- Logger isn't being configured with the LOG_LEVEL from config

**What I Need:**
All tests should pass without any modifications to the test files themselves. The app code needs to be fixed to work correctly.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a new folder called `issue_fixed` and make all your changes there - don't touch the original issue folder
2. Run all the tests automatically using pytest
3. All tests must pass (test_config.py, test_service.py, test_utils.py)
4. Save the test results to a `logs` folder
5. Don't modify or replace any existing tests - just fix the app code to make them pass

Thanks!
