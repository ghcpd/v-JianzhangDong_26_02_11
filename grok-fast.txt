User: Hey, I've got a Python project that's failing its tests and need some help fixing it.

**The Problem:**
The app has a few issues causing test failures:
- The `build_path` function in app/utils.py is using hardcoded forward slashes instead of OS-appropriate path separators, so it's breaking on Windows
- Environment variables from .env file aren't being loaded properly - missing python-dotenv integration
- Logger isn't being configured with the LOG_LEVEL from config

**What I Need:**
All tests should pass without any modifications to the test files themselves. The app code needs to be fixed to work correctly.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a new folder called `issue_fixed` and make all your changes there - don't touch the original issue folder
2. Run all the tests automatically using pytest
3. All tests must pass (test_config.py, test_service.py, test_utils.py)
4. Save the test results to a `logs` folder
5. Don't modify or replace any existing tests - just fix the app code to make them pass

Thanks!

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the Python project and all tests are now passing. Here's what I did:

## Changes Made in issue_fixed folder:

1. **Added python-dotenv dependency** to requirements.txt for loading environment variables from .env files.

2. **Fixed config.py** by importing and calling `load_dotenv()` at the top to properly load environment variables from the .env file.

3. **Fixed utils.py** by replacing the hardcoded forward slash with `os.path.join("data", filename)` to use OS-appropriate path separators.

4. **Fixed logger.py** by updating `setup_logger` to properly convert the string log level to a numeric logging level using `getattr(logging, level.upper(), logging.INFO)`.

5. **Fixed service.py** by importing `setup_logger` and calling it with `Config.LOG_LEVEL` to configure the logger correctly.

## Test Results:
All tests pass successfully:
- test_config.py ✅ (environment variables loaded)
- test_service.py ✅ (logger configured and process runs)
- test_utils.py ✅ (path building uses OS separators)

The test results have been saved to test_results.txt as requested. The project now works correctly on Windows with proper path handling, environment variable loading, and logging configuration.
